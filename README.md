# K-Nearest-Neighbors-and-Naive-Bayes-Emotion-Recognition-With-Python

Machine learning project for image classification using Python and the K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes algorithms.

## The Objective of the project

- For this project, I chose to maintain the initial objective from the previous project, namely the development and implementation of a system for recognizing human emotions from images, using image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. By using a diverse and representative dataset, the project aims to train a model capable of correctly identifying and classifying facial expressions associated with different human emotions.
- At the same time, the efficiency and limitations of the K-nearest neighbors and Na√Øve Bayes algorithms will be explored. Additionally, the evolution of predictions compared to those made in the first project will also be monitored.







## Details

- A more detailed breakdown of the whole development process is included in the Documentatie.pdf file, from the data acquiring process to the presentation of the code, conclusions and performance review.
- The dataset is uploaded as an archive due to it's size.
